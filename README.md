# COVID19 WELL-BEING APP 

## During period this unprecendeted period the majority of the workforce is working from home, it can become quite stressful for people who are staying home glued to work all day. So use the app, take a step back and allow the app to show you a visual presentation of what your day at home is like. 
## The app will generate 30 minute time blocks which allows allows the user to pick the activity they are doing at the particular time - e.g. sleep, eat, work, work out. Upon clicking these, it will then take you to a more relevant selection of tasks. Plan your day / week and review/change if you see there is too much of one thing going on.
